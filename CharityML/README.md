## Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for *CharityML*

## Getting Started

In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

## Exploring the Data
Load necessary Python libraries and load the census data.
<br>
Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.

### Data Exploration
A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, we compute the following:
- The total number of records, `'n_records'`
- The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
- The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
- The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.


```python
# Total number of records
n_records = data.index.shape[0]

# Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000
n_greater_50k = data[data.income == ">50K"].shape[0]

# Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
n_at_most_50k = data[data.income == "<=50K"].shape[0]

# Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = round(n_greater_50k / n_records, 2) * 100

# Print the results
print("Total number of records: {}".format(n_records))
print("Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k))
print("Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k))
print("Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: {}%".format(greater_percent))
```

    Total number of records: 45222
    Individuals making more than $50,000: 11208
    Individuals making at most $50,000: 34014
    Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: 25.0%

## Preparing the Data
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 

The code cell below plots a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.


```python
# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)
```


![png](https://github.com/myntvn/machine-learning/blob/media/CharityML/output_9_0.png)


For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.

The code cell below performs a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 


```python
# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)
features_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_log_transformed, transformed = True)
```


![png](https://github.com/myntvn/machine-learning/blob/media/CharityML/output_11_0.png)


### Normalizing Numerical Features
In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.

The code cell below normalizes each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.


```python
# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']

features_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)
features_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))
```

### Implementation: Data Preprocessing

From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.

You can read more about one-hot-encoding __[here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/)__

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. The code cell below implements the following:
 - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.
 - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
   - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.


```python
# One-hot encode the 'features_log_minmax_transform' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features_final = pd.get_dummies(features_log_minmax_transform)

# Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.map({"<=50K" : 0, ">50K" : 1})

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features_final.columns)
print("{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded)))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
# print(encoded)
```

    103 total features after one-hot encoding.


### Shuffle and Split Data
Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.


```python
# Import train_test_split
# from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_final, 
                                                    income, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, 
                                                    random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print("Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0]))
print("Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0]))
```

    Training set has 36177 samples.
    Testing set has 9045 samples.

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:

$$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$

In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 


#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall

** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).

** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`

** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`

For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).

### Naive Predictor Performace

The purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.


* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. 
* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.


```python
'''
TP = np.sum(income) # Counting the ones as this is the naive case. Note that 'income' is the 'income_raw' data 
encoded to numerical values done in the data preprocessing step.
FP = income.count() - TP # Specific to the naive case

TN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
FN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
'''
# TODO: Calculate accuracy, precision and recall
TP = np.sum(income)
FP = income.count() - TP
TN = 0
FN = 0
accuracy = TP / (TP + FP)
recall = TP / (TP + FN) 
precision = TP / (TP + FP)

# TODO: Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5 and correct values for precision and recall.
fscore = (1 + 0.25) * precision * recall / (0.25 * precision + recall)

# Print the results 
print("Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore))
```

    Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2917]


###  Supervised Learning Models
**The following are some of the supervised learning models that are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

I will list here the real-world applications, strengths and weaknesses of three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate (in my opinion) for this problem.
<br>
Required output is categorical (>50K or <=50K), so this is classification problem and the selected model should be a classification model.

#### Decision Trees
- Application: evaluation of brand expansion opportunities for a business using historical sales data. Or determination of likely buyers of a product using demographic data to enable targeting of limited advertisement budget.
- Strengths: 
    + Decision trees are able to handle both continuous and categorical variables. 
    + Decision trees provide a clear indication of which fields are most important for prediction or classification.
    + Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance.
    + Perform classification without requiring much computation.
- Weaknesses:
    + Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well.
    + Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the data set prior to fitting with the decision tree.
    + Decision trees are prone to errors in classification problems with many class and relatively small number of training examples.
- Decision Trees is a classification model and can handle both continuous and categorical variables (our features include both continuous and categorial data). So I think that I should give it a try.

#### Logistic Regression
- Application: Email spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud, Tumor Malignant or Benign.
- Strengths: 
    + Outputs have a nice probabilistic interpretation, and the algorithm can be regularized to avoid overfitting.
    + DLogistic models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent.
    + Variance is low.
- Weaknesses:
    + Logistic regression tends to underperform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries.
    + They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.
- Logistic regression is a classification model and the output is binary (0 or 1). which is suitable for our problem (>50K or <=50K). Our training data has no misclassified instance and also solved the outlier problem, which is required for the input data of the Logistic regression.

#### Random Forest
- Application: In Banking it is used for example to detect customers who will use the bank’s services more frequently than others and repay their debt in time.In finance, it is used to determine a stock’s behaviour in the future.
- Strengths: 
    + It can be used for both regression and classification
    + Great with High dimensionality.
    + Quick Prediction/Training Speed.
    + Robust to Outliers and Non-linear Data.
    + Low Bias, Moderate Variance
- Weaknesses:
    + It can tend to overfit
    + a large number of trees can make the algorithm to slow and ineffective for real-time predictions.
- It can be used for both regression and classification. It can handle a lot of different feature types, like binary, categorical and numerical, which is suitable for our data.

### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. The code block below implements the following:
 - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).
 - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.
 - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.
   - Record the total prediction time.
 - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.
 - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.
   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!


```python

def train_predict(learner, sample_size, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test): 
    '''

### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
The code cell below implements the following:
- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.
  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model (tuning one specific model will be implemented in a later section.
- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.



```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# import warnings filter
from warnings import simplefilter
# ignore all future warnings
simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)

# Initialize the three models
clf_A = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0)
clf_B = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
clf_C = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)

# Calculate the number of samples for 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data
# samples_100 is the entire training set i.e. len(y_train)
# samples_10 is 10% of samples_100 (ensure to set the count of the values to be `int` and not `float`)
# samples_1 is 1% of samples_100 (ensure to set the count of the values to be `int` and not `float`)
samples_100 = len(y_train)
samples_10 = samples_100 * 10 // 100 
samples_1 = samples_100 // 100

# Collect results on the learners
results = {}
for clf in [clf_A, clf_B, clf_C]:
    clf_name = clf.__class__.__name__
    results[clf_name] = {}
    for i, samples in enumerate([samples_1, samples_10, samples_100]):
        results[clf_name][i] = \
        train_predict(clf, samples, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

# Run metrics visualization for the three supervised learning models chosen
vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)
```

## Improving Results
Select the best model from the three supervised learning models above and perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

### Choosing the Best Model

The Random Forest model will be selected to apply the grid search optimization.
- Logistic regression and Random forest classifier get the same fscore (about 0.65) when 100% of the training data is used while the Decision tree has the lowest score.
- Logistic regression is the fastest model, Random Forest is the slowest model but the prediction/training time is not too slow (over 0.03 second).
- Random Forest can handle a lot of different feature types, like binary, categorical and numerical, which match our data.

### Implementation: Model Tuning
Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. The entire training set will be used for this. The code cell below implement the following:
- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
 - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.
- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
 - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
 - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of the learner if that parameter is available!
- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.



```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

# Initialize the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)

# Create the parameters list you wish to tune, using a dictionary if needed.
# parameters = {'parameter_1': [value1, value2], 'parameter_2': [value1, value2]}
parameters = {'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200], 'max_features': ["log2", None, 50]}

# Make an fbeta_score scoring object using make_scorer()
scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta = 0.5)

# Perform grid search on the classifier using 'scorer' as the scoring method using GridSearchCV()
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf, parameters, scoring = scorer)

# Fit the grid search object to the training data and find the optimal parameters using fit()
grid_fit = grid_obj.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the estimator
best_clf = grid_fit.best_estimator_

# Make predictions using the unoptimized and model
predictions = (clf.fit(X_train, y_train)).predict(X_test)
best_predictions = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Report the before-and-afterscores
print("Unoptimized model\n------")
print("Accuracy score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, predictions, beta = 0.5)))
print("\nOptimized Model\n------")
print("Final accuracy score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions)))
print("Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
```

    Unoptimized model
    ------
    Accuracy score on testing data: 0.8377
    F-score on testing data: 0.6716
    
    Optimized Model
    ------
    Final accuracy score on the testing data: 0.8453
    Final F-score on the testing data: 0.6880


### Final Model Evaluation



|     Metric     | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
| Accuracy Score |  0.8377           |  0.8453         |
| F-score        |  0.6716           |  0.6880         |


- Accuracy score and F-score of the optimized model is better than the unoptimized model but not remarkable. The default value of parameters seem to be good.
- Both the accuracy and the F-score are remarkably increase when compare to the naive predictor.

## Feature Importance

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.

The next python cell uses `feature_importance_` attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

### Extracting Feature Importance
Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.

The code cell below implements the following:
 - Train the supervised model on the entire training set.
 - Extract the feature importances using `'.feature_importances_'`.


```python
# Train the supervised model on the training set using .fit(X_train, y_train)
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ 
importances = model.feature_importances_

# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)
```

### Feature Selection
How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model above and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 


```python
# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

best_clf.max_features = "auto"

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print("Final Model trained on full data\n------")
print("Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
print("\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------")
print("Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, reduced_predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
```

    Final Model trained on full data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8453
    F-score on testing data: 0.6880
    
    Final Model trained on reduced data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8116
    F-score on testing data: 0.6098


### Effects of Feature Selection

- final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features are lower than when all features are used but not remarkable.
- If training time was a factor, I would consider using the reduced data as training set
